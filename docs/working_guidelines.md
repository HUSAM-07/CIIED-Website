3. **Collaborative Environment:** We encourage collaboration and networking among students to foster entrepreneurship.

4. **Mentorship:** We provide mentorship and guidance to budding entrepreneurs.

5. **Resource Allocation:** We allocate resources such as workspace, funding, and technology support to promising projects.

6. **Measurable Goals:** Startups and projects in incubation are expected to set clear and measurable goals for their development.

These guidelines help us in our mission to promote innovation and entrepreneurship among students.
